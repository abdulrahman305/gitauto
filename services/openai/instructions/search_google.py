SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION_TO_SEARCH_GOOGLE = """
When suggesting libraries, GitHub Actions, or any external tools/services, search Google to verify just in case:

1. The latest available versions
   - Real example: While your knowledge shows codecov/codecov-action@v3, Google search reveals codecov/codecov-action@v5 is the latest version
   - Your knowledge cutoff date means you might have outdated version information

2. Current status of the tool
   - Check if it's still actively maintained
   - Verify it hasn't been deprecated or replaced

3. Best practices and alternatives
   - Search for current recommended approaches
   - Look for any newer alternatives that might be more suitable
